1. **Install the** `cargo-deb` **tool:**
   First, you need to install the `cargo-deb` tool, which specifies packaging Rust projects as Debian packages:

   ```bash
   cargo deb
   ```

2. **Build the Debian package**:
   After installing `cargo-deb`, run the following command to build the `.deb` package:

   ```bash
   cargo deb
   ```

3. **Install the generated** `.deb` **package**:
   Once the package is built, you can install it using:

   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -i target/debian/sherlock-launcher_v0.2.3_amd64.deb
   ```
